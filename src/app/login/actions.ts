 * Raised from 6 on 14 Aug 2026.
 *
 * Six was Supabase's default floor, and it was doing very little. Measured
 * against production that day, GoTrue throttles the password grant after
 * roughly 46 failed attempts per window — and the application's own limiter
 * (6 per identifier per 15 minutes) is bypassable, because an attacker can
 * call /auth/v1/token directly with the anon key that ships in the client
 * bundle. Six characters against ~46 guesses a window is not a lot of margin.
 *
 * This is only the application's check. Two things in the Supabase dashboard
 * matter more and are not code:
 *
 *   - Authentication → Policies → **leaked password protection**, which checks
 *     candidates against HaveIBeenPwned. A 12-character password that has
 *     appeared in a breach is weaker than a random 8, and length alone cannot
 *     see that.
 *   - Authentication → Policies → minimum length, which is what actually binds
 *     a caller who skips this form entirely.

 * (it stays open only where the widget itself is not deployed).
 *
 * Order matters: the rate limiter is cheap and local, `siteverify` is a network
