/**
 * The landing page's pilot enquiry form.
 *
 * ── Why this writes with the service role ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This used to insert with the anon client, backed by an anon INSERT policy on
 * contact_requests (0009). That made the rate limit below decorative: the anon
 * key is inlined in the client bundle, so anyone could POST straight to
 * /rest/v1/contact_requests and never touch this code. Verified against
 * production on 14 Aug — a hand-rolled anon insert returned 201.
 *
 * Writing with the service role means the limiter is the only way in, because
 * migration 0029 removes the anon policy and there is then no other path.
 *
 * DEPLOY ORDER MATTERS. This code must be live BEFORE 0029 is applied, or the
 * public form breaks: the running build would still be using the anon client
 * against a policy that no longer exists. 0029 is deliberately left unapplied
 * for that reason.
