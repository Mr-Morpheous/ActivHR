const FAQS = [
  [
    "Is Activ-HR free to try?",
    "Yes. Start a free trial for your organization, no credit card required, and upgrade as your team grows.",
  ],
  [
    "Does it work without an internet connection?",
    "Yes. Clock-ins are queued on the device and synced automatically once a connection is available. The timestamp kept is when the person actually clocked in, not when the phone reconnected.",
  ],
  [
    "How is my organization's data kept separate from others?",
    "Every record is scoped to your organization at the database level with row-level security, so no other organization can see or query your data.",
  ],
  [
    "Can I export attendance data to my payroll provider?",
    "Yes. Approved hours export as CSV, filtered by site, role or date range.",
  ],
  [
    "What devices can my team use to clock in?",
    "Any phone with a browser and GPS, or a shared tablet at the gate. Android and iOS apps, and support for fingerprint and face terminals, are being built.",
  ],
  [
    "Can I set up my own management structure?",
    "Yes. Name your own levels: CEO, head of department, supervisor, whatever you actually use. For each one you set how far it can see, from only themselves up to the entire organization.",
  ],
  [
    "Is there a limit on how many sites or staff I can add?",
    "No limit on sites. You pay $3 per employee per month, so the cost follows your headcount rather than a plan tier.",
  ],
