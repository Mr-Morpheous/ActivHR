/**
 * What it costs.
 *
 * The site did not say, anywhere, until this section existed. An operations
 * manager comparing options cannot put a nameless price in front of a finance
 * director, so "contact us for pricing" loses the deal before the call.
 *
 * $3 per seat per month is the `seat_price_usd` default from migration 0019, and
 * a billable seat is staff or manager — not the org_admin who bought it. Both
 * are stated below because a buyer who discovers the counting rule on their
 * first invoice trusts the next number less.
 *
 * PAYMENT IS HONEST ABOUT BEING MANUAL. `recordPayment` records an M-Pesa
 * reference and a human confirms it; nothing is charged automatically. A buyer
 * finding that out later is worse than being told now, and it is genuinely fine
 * for the size of customer this sells to.
