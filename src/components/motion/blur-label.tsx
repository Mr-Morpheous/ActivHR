/**
 * Word-by-word blur reveal for a short plain-string label (the mono
 * eyebrows above section headings). Safe to split per word here because,
 * unlike the headings, these carry no inline markup.
 *
 * BlurText renders a flex-wrap <p>; under reduced motion this falls back to
 * a plain <p> with the same classes so layout doesn't shift.
 *
 * **The fallback is gated on mount, not applied during render.** BlurText
 * splits the string into one span per word, and the plain fallback is a single
 * text node — so branching on `useReducedMotion()` during render means the
 * server emits one structure and a reduced-motion client's first render emits
 * another. That is React hydration error #418, and it was live on the landing
 * page until the 10 Aug browser pass emulated `prefers-reduced-motion` for the
 * first time. Keeping the first client render identical to the server's, and
 * swapping afterwards, is what fixes it.
