/**
 * Blur-to-crisp heading reveal.
 *
 * React Bits ships BlurText and SplitText for this, but both take a plain
 * string and split it into per-word spans — which would destroy the
 * `<span className="italic text-primary">` accent that every heading on
 * this site is built around. This keeps the children as authored and
 * animates the heading as one block instead, so the effect reads the same
 * without costing the brand's signature device.
 *
 * The reduced-motion branch is gated on mount. A plain `<h2>` and a
 * `motion.h2` carrying `initial` styles differ in their emitted attributes, so
 * choosing between them during render from a browser-only value is a hydration
 * mismatch — React #418, reported against HTML rather than text. Same fix as
 * `blur-label.tsx` and `site/stat-value.tsx`; see doc 13.
